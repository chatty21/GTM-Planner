A lightweight decision tool that helps a startup choose which tech YouTubers to sponsor and how to split a fixed budget for the best mix of reach and efficiency.

What inspired me

I kept seeing creator budgets decided by gut feel‚Äî‚Äúwe‚Äôve always sponsored X‚Äù or ‚Äúthat video looked big.‚Äù I wanted a portfolio project that felt like a real GTM Analyst workflow: turn public data into benchmarks, transform assumptions into clear plans, and ship it as a simple product non-technical teammates can use. This app is the result.

‚∏ª

What the app does
	‚Ä¢	Benchmark top tech creators on recent reach (30/90-day views), CPM proxies, and ROI proxies.
	‚Ä¢	Plan a budget using three strategies:
	‚Ä¢	Inverse CPM (efficiency): cheapest impressions win more budget
	‚Ä¢	Recent Views (reach): active audience gets priority
	‚Ä¢	Subscribers (fallback upper-funnel)
	‚Ä¢	Risk controls: cap per creator, HHI & top-share metrics, optional diminishing returns penalty.
	‚Ä¢	Sensitivity bands: pessimistic/base/optimistic CPM to show outcome ranges.
	‚Ä¢	Exports: CSV/XLSX plans and a one-pager (Markdown) for sharing.

‚∏ª

How I built it (stack & flow)
	‚Ä¢	App: Streamlit (streamlit_app.py)
	‚Ä¢	Data: public YouTube channel stats (lifetime + recent uploads aggregated to get 30/90-day views).
	‚Ä¢	Modeling:
	‚Ä¢	CPM proxies (90-day when available, lifetime fallback)
	‚Ä¢	Engagement proxy (TotalViews/Subscribers)
	‚Ä¢	Allocation under constraints with optional diminishing returns
	‚Ä¢	Concentration measured via Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
	‚Ä¢	Outputs: interactive tables & charts, downloadables (CSV/XLSX/MD).

‚∏ª

Data, assumptions & disclaimers
	‚Ä¢	Uses public stats; no private YouTube Analytics.
	‚Ä¢	CPM/ROI are planning proxies (not sponsor quotes). Great for scenario planning, not contracts.
	‚Ä¢	Optional Category/Region tagging is editable in-app to align with your ICP.
	‚Ä¢	If you have real rate cards or private analytics, plug them in to replace the proxies.

Upload your CSV in the sidebar or keep a small sample CSV in the repo so the app renders instantly.

üîß Using your own data

Minimum columns the app understands (extra columns are fine):
	‚Ä¢	ChannelTitle, Subscribers, TotalViews, VideoCount
	‚Ä¢	Views_30d, Views_90d, Uploads_90d, AvgViewsPerRecent
	‚Ä¢	CPM_90d, CPM_lifetime (proxies), ROI_90d (optional)
	‚Ä¢	SpendUSD (optional), Category, Region (optional)

If a field is missing, the app will create safe defaults; 90-day CPM falls back to lifetime if needed.

‚∏ª

üßÆ How to read the plan
	‚Ä¢	Weighted CPM ‚Äî effective CPM across the whole plan
	‚Ä¢	Projected Impressions ‚Äî spend / CPM √ó 1000 (scenario-adjusted)
	‚Ä¢	HHI ‚Äî concentration risk (0‚Äì1; higher = riskier). Keep a lid on top-creator share.
	‚Ä¢	Sensitivity (CPM ¬±%) ‚Äî shows range when CPM moves against/for you.

‚∏ª

üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	Input real rate cards and compare to proxy CPM
	‚Ä¢	Category/ICP quotas in the allocator
	‚Ä¢	Linear programming optimizer with minimums/caps
	‚Ä¢	Bandit reallocation using live campaign performance
	‚Ä¢	Reach forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet)

‚∏ª

üìé Credits
	‚Ä¢	Built with Streamlit, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
	‚Ä¢	Concept inspired by real startup GTM budgeting pains and creator marketing best practices
